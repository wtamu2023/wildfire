# 2023 Texas AM Data Science Competition

The purpose of this repository is to display the R code used to generate
the visualizations used for the Team Firewatch submission.

## Contents

This project uses voronoi diagrams to determine the land area each municipality
mush surveil as part of a wildfire surveilance program in order to acheive total
land coverage.

It is recommended to provide subsidies for wildfire surveilance and to also provide
local outreach to civilians about how to respond to a wildfire and how to prevent it
